# Handspring Alumni Slack

## What & Why?

At a recent small gathering of Handspring folk, we discussed how much we missed working with each other. And that it was a shame that we didn't have more of our bigger gatherings.

Davis Frank and Mark Dadgar had lunch after that and dug deeper. They (we) talked about leveraging networks and how Handspring folks hiring, or even just filtering for what we value, is very useful.

Mark runs the ex-Handspring email list. But it's been quiet enought that we decided to experiment with a Slack. And here we are. Welcome!

## Membership

The Alumni Slack is open to anyone who had an @handspring.com email address. It's that simple. 

## Code of Conduct
